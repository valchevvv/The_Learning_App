This is the front-end of this app.

To run it you will need to do the following steps:
1. If there is no .env file you will need to create it or default running port will be 1338.
2. Run `npm i` to install all modules that are required
3. You can change running port if you want. You can do this from `PORT` in `.env` file.

4. To run it just type `npm run start`.

If you want to change something of the design -> everything is in the `/src` folder.

That is. Enjoy.
